# odin-recipies
This is my first project, and I am excited about it!
I misspelled the word 'recipes' (:
I am going to make a website about some recipes, and I will show that I am capable of: 
    Making a simple HTML page that contains: links, images, text.
    Using git.
    Making a good commit message.
